for naming/describing an individual test, go with
1. (Given) some context
2. (When) some action is carried out
3. (Then) a particular set of observable consequences should obtain

for an ordinary test, format is
1. Arrange / Assemble -> Set up & initialize on the required objects (can also be done in setUp function)
2. Act -> Run the action whose result to be tested
3. Assert -> Compare result against some standard e.g. in `expect`

for bloc test, you
1. provide the bloc/cubit in `build`,
2. add the event/call function in `act` and
3. list the expected state(s) in the order of being emitted in `expect`

for testing functionality that has dependencies, replace those dependencies with mocks
this can be provided by the `mockito` package which comes included in `bloc_test` package
